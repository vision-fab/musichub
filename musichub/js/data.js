Midnight City

[Verse 1]
Waiting in a car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
The night city grows
Look and see her eyes, they glow

[Chorus]
Waiting in a car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lounge
Following the neon signs
Waiting for the roar
Sound of the storm, downtown
Midnight City
Come and find me

[Verse 2]
Waiting for a star
To fall and carry us all away
The night holds a promise
Come and find me, find me

[Chorus]
Waiting in a car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lounge
Following the neon signs
Waiting for the roar
Sound of the storm, downtown
Midnight City
Come and find me

[Bridge]
The city is my church
It wraps me in the sparkling twilight
The night is my companion
Solitude my guide

[Outro]
Midnight City
Come and find me
In the midnight city
Come and find me...`,

        lyrics: `[Instrumental Piece]

The Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 2, is a piano sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. It was completed in 1801 and dedicated in 1802 to his pupil Countess Julie "Giulietta" Guicciardi.

Commonly known as the Moonlight Sonata, the piece is one of Beethoven's most popular compositions for the piano. The name "Moonlight Sonata" comes from remarks made by the German music critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab, who compared the effect of the first movement to that of moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne.

The sonata consists of three movements:
1. Adagio sostenuto
2. Allegretto
3. Presto agitato

This sonata is unusual as the first movement is slow, the second movement is a minuet and trio (moderately paced), and the third movement is fast and furious.

The first movement, marked Adagio sostenuto, is the most famous and is what people most commonly associate with the Moonlight Sonata. It is written in a vague, shadowy manner, with a hypnotic triplet accompaniment and a mournful, seemingly improvisational melody.

The piece remains one of the most enduring and recognizable works in the classical piano repertoire, beloved by musicians and audiences alike for its emotional depth and technical brilliance.`,

        lyrics: `[Intro]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

[Verse 1]
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

[Outro]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying a stairway to heaven`,
